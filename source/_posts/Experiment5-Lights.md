title: Experiment 5 Lights 
tags: [Computer Graphics]

A 3D virtual world has three major components: objects, lights, and cameras. This unit is going to explore lights; the next, cameras. These components are on opposite ends of the rendering process: photons are generated at light sources, and the photons that reach the camera are what form the image. The objects in the scene are what ties these two ends of the process together.

## 1. Experiment goal
- Understand basic knowledge of lights; 
- Learn how to set and control the light in the scene.


## 2. Experiment content
Please do the following code exercises in Lesson 14 "Problem Set" of Lights after you study or review Lesson 13 Lights:
- Exercise 2 "Swivel Light Control";
- Exercise 3 "Swivel and Tilt Light Control";

## 3. Experiment report
Write your experiment report based on experiment report template according to your experiment process and save the code file.  For easy to statistics and archive, please submit experiment report and the code file to ketangpai platform.
